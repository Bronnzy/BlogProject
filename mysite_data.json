Blazkowicz is Keen’s grandfather, and Keen is Doom Guy’s father or grandfather. According to Tom Hall, Doom Guy is the grandson of Commander Keen. The website for Doom RPG does state that the player in Doom RPG is the same character from Doom, Doom II, and Doom 3.</p>\r\n\r\n        <h2>Is Doomguy the Slayer?</h2>\r\n        <p>The Doom Slayer is the protagonist and playable character of Doom, Doom II: Hell on Earth, Final Doom, Doom 64, Doom (2016), Quake Champions, Quake III Arena, and Doom Eternal (and possibly Doom 3).</p>\r\n\r\n        <h2>Can the Doom Slayer die?</h2>\r\n        <p class=\"highlight\">[Fan theory] Doom Slayer can be killed, but he can resurrect himself infinitely. When the demons dropped a temple on Doom Slayer, they had a chance to kill him but didn’t. When the Doom Slayer is killed, time itself is reversed to a few minutes before that fight, and Doom Slayer is resurrected with the memory of his death.</p>\r\n\r\n        <h2>What does the mark of the Doom Slayer mean?</h2>\r\n        <p>The mark of the Doom Slayer serves as a warning to all of Hell.</p>\r\n\r\n        <h2>Who can beat Doomguy?</h2>\r\n        <p class=\"note\">1. Can’t Beat: Kratos (God Of War) — This stems from his journey for vengeance and his ability to kill any god in his way. Kratos has killed many gods in his lifetime and continues his mission until completed. Doomguy is still only a mortal, even though he slaughters like a god.</p>\r\n\r\n        <h2>Is it Doomguy or Doom Slayer?</h2>\r\n        <p>Doomguy, also referred to as the Doom Marine and Doom Slayer in later installments of the franchise, is a fictional character and the protagonist in the Doom video game franchise created by id Software, and its sequels and spin-off media.</p>\r\n\r\n        <h2>Are Doomguy and Doom Slayer the same person?</h2>\r\n        <p>The codex entries and cutscenes in DOOM Eternal bridge the rebooted series (DOOM 2016 and DOOM Eternal) to the original series and confirm that Doomguy, aka Doom Marine, is definitely the same person as the Doom Slayer.</p>\r\n\r\n        <h2>Are Doomguy and Isabelle friends?</h2>\r\n        <p>Isabelle, the adorable pooch from Animal Crossing, and the Doom protagonist have come together to show that friendship can transcend games. In July 2019, a Twitter user posted fanart of the two together, with Doomguy teaching Isabelle how to fire the Super Shotgun.</p>\r\n\r\n        <h2>How powerful is Doom Slayer?</h2>\r\n        <p>The Doom Slayer has infinite strength, as his Praetor Suit absorbs Argent Energy, which greatly enhances Doomguy’s physical strength. He has been absorbing Argent Energy for eons, giving him seemingly limitless strength.</p>\r\n\r\n        <h2>Is Doomguy immortal?</h2>\r\n        <p>In this case, there’s no immortality for Doomguy other than the fact that he doesn’t age at the same rate during an FTL trip and returns to Earth a few hundred years later because of it.</p>\r\n\r\n        <h2>Is the Doom Slayer a God?</h2>\r\n        <p>No, the Doom Slayer is not a god. He is something worse than a god; he is revenge. This betrayal caused the already damned Doom Slayer to dedicate his eternity to destroying Hell itself. He is a self-made engine of revenge, punishing all of Hell for its wickedness.</p>\r\n\r\n        <h2>Is Doomguy a God?</h2>\r\n        <p>No, the Doom Slayer is not a god.</p>\r\n</body>",

The music and sound effects were created by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Robert_Prince_(video_game_composer)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Robert Prince (video game composer)\">Bobby Prince</a>.\r\n</p><p>The <i>Doom</i> concept was proposed in late 1992, after the release of <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wolfenstein_3D\" title=\"Wolfenstein 3D\">Wolfenstein 3D</a></i> and its sequel <i>Spear of Destiny</i>. John Carmack was working on an improved 3D <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Game_engine\" title=\"Game engine\">game engine</a> from those games, and the team wanted to have their next game take advantage of his designs. Several ideas were proposed, including a new game in their <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Commander_Keen\" title=\"Commander Keen\">Commander Keen</a></i> series, but John proposed a game about using technology to fight demons inspired by the <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dungeons_%26_Dragons\" title=\"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></i> campaigns the team played. The initial months of development were spent building prototypes, while Hall created the <i>Doom Bible</i>, a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Design_document\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Design document\">design document</a> for his vision of the game and its story; after id released a grandiose press release touting features that the team had not yet begun working on, the <i>Doom Bible</i> was rejected in favor of a plotless game with no design document at all.\r\n</p><p>Over the next six months, Hall designed levels based on real military bases, Romero built features, and artists Adrian Carmack and Cloud created <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Texture_mapping\" title=\"Texture mapping\">textures</a> and demons based on clay models they built. Hall's level designs, however, were deemed uninteresting and Romero began designing his own levels; Hall, increasingly frustrated with his limited influence, was fired in July. He was replaced by Petersen in September, and the team worked increasingly long hours until the game was completed in December 1993. <i>Doom</i> was self-published by id on December 10, 1993, and immediately downloaded by thousands of players.\r\n</p>\r\n<meta property=\"mw:PageProp/toc\">\r\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading2\"><h2 id=\"Design\">Design</h2><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Development_of_Doom&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: Design\"><span>edit</span></a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></div>\r\n<figure class=\"mw-default-size\" typeof=\"mw:File/Thumb\"><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:John_Carmack_E3_2006.jpg\" class=\"mw-file-description\"><img alt=\"Black and white photo of the head and shoulders of a man wearing glasses\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a6/John_Carmack_E3_2006.jpg/220px-John_Carmack_E3_2006.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"220\" height=\"220\" class=\"mw-file-element\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a6/John_Carmack_E3_2006.jpg/330px-John_Carmack_E3_2006.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a6/John_Carmack_E3_2006.jpg/440px-John_Carmack_E3_2006.jpg 2x\" data-file-width=\"682\" data-file-height=\"681\"></a><figcaption><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=John_Carmack\" title=\"John Carmack\">John Carmack</a> in 2006</figcaption></figure>\r\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"Concept\">Concept</h3><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Development_of_Doom&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Concept\"><span>edit</span></a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></div>\r\n<p>In May 1992, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Id_Software\" title=\"Id Software\">id Software</a> released <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wolfenstein_3D\" title=\"Wolfenstein 3D\">Wolfenstein 3D</a>.</i> It is often referred to as the \"grandfather\" of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=First-person_shooter\" title=\"First-person shooter\">first-person shooters</a>,<sup id=\"cite_ref-CGWHallofFame_4-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-CGWHallofFame-4\">[4]</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-VGB_5-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-VGB-5\">[5]</a></sup> setting expectations for fast-paced action and new technology, and greatly increased the genre's popularity.<sup id=\"cite_ref-CGWHallofFame_4-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-CGWHallofFame-4\">[4]</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-AGGreview_6-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-AGGreview-6\">[6]</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-IGN100_7-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-IGN100-7\">[7]</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-WIREDretro_8-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-WIREDretro-8\">[8]</a></sup> Immediately following its release, most of the team began work on a set of new <i>Wolfenstein</i> episodes, <i>Spear of Destiny</i>. As the episodes used the same <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Game_engine\" title=\"Game engine\">game engine</a> as the original game, id co-founder and lead programmer <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=John_Carmack\" title=\"John Carmack\">John Carmack</a> instead focused on technology research for the company's next game, just as he had experimented with creating a 3D game engine prior to the development of <i>Wolfenstein 3D</i>. Between May and <i>Spear of Destiny</i><span class=\"nowrap\" style=\"padding-left:0.1em;\">'</span>s release in September 1992, he created several experimental engines, including one for a racing game, before working on an enhanced version of the <i>Wolfenstein</i> engine to be licensed to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Raven_Software\" title=\"Raven Software\">Raven Software</a> for their game <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=ShadowCaster\" title=\"ShadowCaster\">ShadowCaster</a></i>. For this engine, he developed several enhancements to the <i>Wolfenstein</i> engine, including sloped floors, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Texture_mapping\" title=\"Texture mapping\">textures</a> on the floors and ceilings in addition to the walls, and fading visibility over a distance. The resulting engine was much slower than the <i>Wolfenstein</i> one, but was deemed acceptable for an adventure game like <i>ShadowCaster</i>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-MOD118121_9-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-MOD118121-9\">[9]</a></sup>\r\n</p><p>Following the release of <i>Spear of Destiny</i> and the completion of the <i>ShadowCaster</i> engine, id Software discussed what their next game would be. They wanted to create another 3D game using Carmack's new engine as a starting point, but were largely tired of <i>Wolfenstein</i>. Lead designer <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tom_Hall\" title=\"Tom Hall\">Tom Hall</a> was especially weary of it, and pushed for the team to make another game in the <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Commander_Keen\" title=\"Commander Keen\">Commander Keen</a></i> series; the team had created seven episodes in the series in 1990–91 as their first games, but the planned third set of episodes had been dropped in favor of <i>Wolfenstein 3D</i>. While Carmack was initially interested in the idea, the rest of the team was not. They collectively felt that the platforming gameplay of the series was a poor fit for Carmack's fast-paced 3D engines, and especially after the success of <i>Wolfenstein</i> were interested in pursuing more games of that type. Additionally, the other two co-founders of id were not interested in creating another <i>Keen</i> game: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=John_Romero\" title=\"John Romero\">John Romero</a>, the designer of <i>Wolfenstein</i>, was not interested in doing another \"cutesy\" game, and lead artist Adrian Carmack preferred to create art in a darker style than the <i>Keen</i> games. John Carmack soon lost interest in <i>Keen</i> idea as well, instead coming up with his own concept: a game about using technology to fight demons, inspired by the <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dungeons_%26_Dragons\" title=\"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></i> campaigns the team played, combining the styles of <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Evil_Dead_II\" title=\"Evil Dead II\">Evil Dead II</a></i> and <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Aliens_(film)\" title=\"Aliens (film)\">Aliens</a></i>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-MOD118121_9-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-MOD118121-9\">[9]</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-GDC2011_10-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-GDC2011-10\">[10]</a></sup> The concept originally had a working title of \"Green and Pissed\", which was also the name of a concept Hall had proposed prior to <i>Wolfenstein</i>, but Carmack soon named the proposed game after a line in the film <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Color_of_Money\" title=\"The Color of Money\">The Color of Money</a></i>: \"'What's in the case?' / 'In here?

They also cut ties with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=3D_Realms\" title=\"3D Realms\">Apogee Software</a>, who had given them the initial advance money for creating their first game, <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Commander_Keen_in_Invasion_of_the_Vorticons\" title=\"Commander Keen in Invasion of the Vorticons\">Commander Keen in Invasion of the Vorticons</a></i>, and through which they had published the shareware versions of their games to date. While they had a good personal relationship with owner <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Scott_Miller_(entrepreneur)\" title=\"Scott Miller (entrepreneur)\">Scott Miller</a>, they felt that they were outgrowing the publisher. Cloud, who was involved in id's business dealings, pushed for id to take over shareware publishing duties themselves after investigating and finding that Apogee was unable to reliably handle the volume of customers buying id's games through Apogee. He convinced the others that the increased sales revenue would make up for the problems of handling their own publishing. The two companies parted amicably, and <i>Doom</i> was set to be self-published.<sup id=\"cite_ref-MOD122123_13-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-MOD122123-13\">[13]</a></sup>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"mw-heading mw-heading3\"><h3 id=\"Development\">Development</h3><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Development_of_Doom&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Development\"><span>edit</span></a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></div>\r\n<figure class=\"mw-default-size mw-halign-right\" typeof=\"mw:File/Thumb\"><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:John_Romero_-_Jason_Scott_interview_(6951215353)_(cropped).jpg\" class=\"mw-file-description\"><img alt=\"Face of a smiling man with long black hair and glasses\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/02/John_Romero_-_Jason_Scott_interview_%286951215353%29_%28cropped%29.jpg/170px-John_Romero_-_Jason_Scott_interview_%286951215353%29_%28cropped%29.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"170\" height=\"222\" class=\"mw-file-element\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/02/John_Romero_-_Jason_Scott_interview_%286951215353%29_%28cropped%29.jpg/255px-John_Romero_-_Jason_Scott_interview_%286951215353%29_%28cropped%29.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/02/John_Romero_-_Jason_Scott_interview_%286951215353%29_%28cropped%29.jpg/340px-John_Romero_-_Jason_Scott_interview_%286951215353%29_%28cropped%29.jpg 2x\" data-file-width=\"607\" data-file-height=\"792\"></a><figcaption><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=John_Romero\" title=\"John Romero\">John Romero</a> in 2012</figcaption></figure>\r\n<p>Early in development, rifts in the team began to appear. Hall, who despite having wanted to develop a different game remained the lead designer and creative director for the company, did not want <i>Doom</i> to have the same lack of plot as <i>Wolfenstein 3D</i>. At the end of November he delivered a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Software_design_description\" title=\"Software design description\">design document</a>, which he named the <i>Doom Bible</i>, that described the plot, backstory, and design goals for the project.<sup id=\"cite_ref-GDC2011_10-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-GDC2011-10\">[10]</a></sup> His design was a science fiction horror concept wherein scientists on the Moon open a portal from which aliens emerge. Over a series of levels the player discovers that the aliens are demons; Hell also steadily infects the level design as the atmosphere becomes darker and more terrifying.<sup id=\"cite_ref-MOD124131_14-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-MOD124131-14\">[14]</a></sup> While Romero initially liked the idea, John Carmack not only disliked it but dismissed the idea of having a story at all: \"Story in a game is like story in a porn movie; it's expected to be there, but it's not that important.\" Rather than a deep story, John Carmack wanted to focus on the technological innovations, dropping the levels and episodes of <i>Wolfenstein</i> in favor of a fast, continuous world. Hall disliked the idea, but Romero sided with Carmack. Although John Carmack was the lead programmer rather than a designer, he was becoming seen in the company as the most important source of ideas; the company considered taking out <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Key_person_insurance\" title=\"Key person insurance\">key person insurance</a> on Carmack but no one else.<sup id=\"cite_ref-MOD124131_14-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-MOD124131-14\">[14]</a></sup>\r\n</p><p>Hall spent the next few weeks reworking the <i>Doom Bible</i> to work with Carmack's technological ideas, while the rest of the team planned how they could implement them.<sup id=\"cite_ref-GDC2011_10-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-GDC2011-10\">[10]</a></sup> His adjusted vision for the plot had the player character assigned to a large military base on an alien planet, Tei Tenga.

John Carmack and Romero, however, disliked Hall's military base-inspired level design.
